# WEB3 Platforms and Decentralized Infrastructure Transform Maritime.
## Maritime WEB3 Industrial Research Workshop and Conference Athens 2023
We are announcing an industrial research workshop to promote infrastructure innovation on maritime buit on web3 platformss. The intention of this workshop is to develop a decentralized web3 platform powered by zero-knowledge cryptography to create a shared open scalable infrastructure for maritime, shipping, freight markets and international trade. At the end of this 20 moth program, teams will present built prototypes at the  WEB3 Maritime Athens 2023 Conference.<br><br> 
This project enables industry leaders to participate as launching partners in and support industrial research in  Maritime infrastructure and application platforms. The workshop shapes the vision, specifications, and strategy and builds prototypes for web3-blockchain platforms that can scale globally.<br><br> 
### web3 blockchain can provoke digital infrastructure into existence
"Web3 has stunned the world by forging a parallel system of finance of unprecedented flexibility and creativity in less than a decade." This demonstrates the disrupting power web3 systems possess to bring alternative online internet environments into existence.
We see Web3 as a unique opportunity to unlockc the true potential of maritime. On top of web3 we can build the foundation of new financial and digital infrastructure systems that change maritime, shipping, and international trade for the better. <br><br>
### The role of industry leaders
Leaders in the Maritime Shipping have two options: assume the responsibility of shepherding Web 3-maritime innovation in a manner that’s consistent with the industry’s values, or cede this role to others with a different, divergent set of priorities. The choice should be clear.

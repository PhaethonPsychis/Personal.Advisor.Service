# Maritime WEB3 Industrial Research Workshop 
### WEB3 Platforms and Decentralized Infrastructure Transform Maritime. Conference Athens 2023

We are announcing an industrial research workshop to promote infrastructure innovation on maritime built on web3 platformss powered by zero-knowledge cryptography. The aim of this workshop is to shape the vision, specifications, and strategy for a shared decentralized open infrastructure ecosystem consisting of interoperable platform applications that can scale globally.<br><br> 
We are developing prototypes in:

### Vision and Architecture


### Base infrastructure protocol prototype

At the end of this 20 moth program, teams will present built prototypes at the  WEB3 Maritime Athens 2023 Conference.<br><br> 

### Interoperable applications ecosystem
Supply chain full service platforms
Decentralized Automated Freight Markets
Data markets platform
Decentralized Financial Institutions and alternative finance products




### The role of industry leaders
Leaders in the Maritime Shipping have two options: assume the responsibility of shepherding Web 3-maritime innovation in a manner that’s consistent with the industry’s values, or cede this role to others with a different, divergent set of priorities. The choice should be clear.

# Become an industry research partner.
This project enables industry leaders to participate as launching partners in and support industrial research in  Maritime infrastructure and application platforms. Do you want to participate through our partners and sponsors program? Interested in taking advantage of these digital infrastructure systems in your organization? Schedule an in-person meeting with us.<br><br>
Let’s bring the web3 to Maritime!

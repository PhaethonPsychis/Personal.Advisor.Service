# The Web3 Maritime Foundation 
Supporting decentralized maritime-infrastructure innovation on web3 platforms.<br><br>
WMF is founded on a simple and powerful purpose: to enable a decentralized digital infrastructure  for the maritime industry where market participants coordinate and act toward a collective future  <br><br>
The state of existing infrastructure is neither desirable nor sustainable. Constructing a web3 digital ecosystem is a task too large and too important for any corporate organization to tackle on its own.  Market participants, policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, and investors all need to collaborate in this work. <br><br> 
By bringing together Web3 and maritime we create the potential for the industry to explore new futures, achieve environmental goals, and create new markets. In decentralized systems, value accrues to the platform and its users rather than intermediaries. These systems are much more resilient because they are distributed and maintained by market-driven open-source communities. 
 
## WMF pillars
WMF main value proposition is to enable secure, private, low-cost transfers of data in a public decentralized network, where the industry can freely develop ecosystems of applications and services

### Digital infrastructure autonomy
We support experimental base protocols that use novel technologies, such as zero-knowledge cryptography. WMF projects aim to push the boundaries of what is technically possible in public infrastructure systems and collective ownership and development.
### Application  ecosystem 
Web3-Maritime requires new tools and applications. We encourage the development on open ecosystem values, of composable technologies.
### Education and coordination of market participants.<br>
We raise awareness and build capacity. We bring more shipping and maritime companies, developers, technologists, and leaders to the frontiers of decentralized web3 maritime development. We do this through educational programs, and other community initiatives.<br> 

The Web3 Maritime Foundation, 0XMAR, is entirely funded by the workshops and advisor services we deliver.

# WMF is a web3-organisation
In the future WMF will offer digital membership to maritime organizations and companies that are ready to embrace industry wide digital technology in their operations. The WMF initiative is establishing novel decentralized management and governance structures that we will anounce soon. You can think of WMF as the Web 3 version of a credit union or cooperative: think of a community of people that contribute to the joint development of a product, rather than a product being engineered and sold to individuals. We welcome you to join us and make a difference together.<br>

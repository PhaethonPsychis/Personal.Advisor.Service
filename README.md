# The Web3 Maritime Foundation 
The Web3 Maritime Foundation supports and develops decentralized operational infrastructure for the maritime-shipping industry on blockchain platforms. WMF envisions a maritime future where web3 is the technological base for building financial, digital, and supply chain infrastructure ecosystems. <br>
The state of existing infrastructure is neither desirable nor sustainable. Constructing a web3 digital ecosystem is a task too large and too important for any corporate organization to tackle on its own.  Market participants, policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, and investors all need to collaborate in this work. WMF is founded to enable the industry to act collectively and coordinate toward an advanced digital future.<br><br> 
 
The domains we work on are:<br><br>
### Digital infrastructure autonomy
We support experimental decentralized applications that use novel technologies, such as zero-knowledge cryptography. We support projects aiming to push the boundaries of what is technically possible with blockchain applications and open-source tools. 

### Application ecosystem.<br> 
Web3-Maritime requires new tools and infrastructure. We encourage the development of these tools with open ecosystem values.
### Education and coordination.<br>
We raise awareness and build capacity. We bring more shipping and maritime companies, developers, technologists, and leaders to the frontiers of decentralized web3 maritime development. We do this through educational programs, and other community initiatives.<br> <br> 

The Web3 Maritime Foundation, 0XMAR, is entirely funded by the workshops and advisor services we deliver.

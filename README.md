# The Web3 Maritime Foundation 
Supporting a shared digital infrastructure platform for the maritime industry on open web3-blockchains .<br><br>

### Vision
WMF is created to promote a vision that sees many companies and platforms in the maritime industry in the near future interacting with each other through a  open source applications for international trade and shipping management built on top of shared decentralized infrastructure network.<br><br>
### Mission
WMF has a simple and powerful mission: to enable the maritime industry to develop and share a decentralized digital infrastructure where market participants collaborate to build the platform's technology. Anyone can use the network to compete in offering users applications for products and markets. These technological innovations are interoperable and composable by design. Market participants can leverage the platform they own to move away from siloed and inefficient centralized systems and build an open ecosystem of innovative applications. 

# Shared infrastructure and application platform
### The problem
The maritime shipping and international trade industry operate on disconnected proprietary platforms. Market participants rely on multiple proprietary platforms, provided by one or more intermediaries, that encompass infrastructure and rules required by users to transact with each other. 
### A design decision
A fundamental design decision for the industry that aspires to achieve operational efficiency, become carbon neutral, and expand it, is whether to preserve proprietary controlled platforms or develop open blockchain platforms that rivals can share. <br><br>
On a decentralized shared platform, such as an open blockchain, multiple firms and developers collaborate in developing the platform's technology that constitutes infrastructure for the industry. Anyone can use the network to compete in offering users interoperable and composable applications. Because the applications are built on the same platform they create a decentralized ecosystem of services. In decentralized systems, value accrues to the platform and its users rather than intermediaries. These systems are much more resilient because they are distributed and maintained by open-source communities.
###  Open-source development
Building a web3 digital ecosystem is a task too large and too important for any corporate organization to tackle on its own. Market participants, policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, and investors all need to collaborate in this work. WMF promotes projects build on open-source to harness the power of collective development <br><br> 

 
## WMF pillars

### Shared digital infrastructure
WMF is focused on creating and scaling digital web3 maritime with the use of zero-knowledge cryptography technologies. WMF supports projects that use the Ethereum as a data availability and settlement layer. Our aim is to reach market sooner rather than later with strong security guarantees. 
### Application platform and ecosystem 
Web3-Maritime requires new open-source platforms that are permission-free. WMF is committed to fostering the growth of Web3-maritime applications by providing the infrastructure needed for Web3-maritime. 
### Education and coordination of market participants.<br>
We raise awareness and build capacity. We bring more shipping and maritime companies, developers, technologists, and leaders to the frontiers of decentralized web3 maritime development. We do this through educational programs, and other community initiatives.<br> 

# WMF is a web3-organisation
We are at the frontier of a new kind of organization: one that supports a web3 blockchain maritime ecosystem, without controlling it. Every day we learn more about what kind of organization the WMF needs to be, to support web3-maritime long-term growth.
You can think of WMF as an ecosystem of people, teams and corporations that contribute to the joint development of a technology product, rather than a product being engineered and sold to individuals. We welcome you to join us and make a difference together.<br><br>

Upcoming milestones for WMF include: Organize the web3 maritime Athens 2023 conference, develop a digital membership service to leverage partnerships with interesting parties, and launch an internal investment fund tasked with supporting web3 maritime application level projects.<br><br>

The Web3 Maritime Foundation is up to now, entirely funded by the workshops and the advisor services we deliver.

# workshop #1
### Building the Greek web3-maritime ecosystem 
The only way to get into web3 and understand what is going on is by doing. This workshop will show you how to use web3 and how to combine it with your knowledge and competence from the shipping industry to create the future of maritime and reach maximal operational efficiency. Lead the development of the Greek web3-maritime ecosystem.<br>

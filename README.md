# The Web3 Maritime Foundation 
promotes the creation of a web3-maritime ecosystem and application-level innovation on decentralized platforms. Our primary areas of focus are:<br><br>

### Research and development. <br> 
We support experimental decentralized applications that use novel technologies, such as zero-knowledge cryptography. We support projects aiming to push the boundaries of what is technically possible with blockchain applications and open-source tools

### Application ecosystem and infrastructure.<br> 
Web3-Maritime requires new tools and infrastructure. We encourage the development of these tools with open ecosystem values.
### Education and community development.<br>
We raise awareness and build capacity. We bring more shipping and maritime companies, developers, technologists, and leaders to the frontiers of decentralized web3 maritime development. We do this through educational programs, and other community initiatives.<br> <br> 

The Web3 Maritime Foundation, 0XMAR, is entirely funded by the workshops and advisor services we deliver.

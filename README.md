# The Web3 Maritime Foundation 
Supporting a shared digital infrastructure platform for the maritime industry on open web3-blockchains .<br><br>
### Vision
WMF is an association created to promote a vision that sees many companies and platforms of the maritime industry in the near future interacting with each other through a shared decentralized infrastructure and open source applications for international trade and shipping management<br><br>
### Mission
WMF has a simple and powerful mission: to enable the maritime industry to develop and share a decentralized digital infrastructure where market participants collaborate to build the platform's technology. Anyone can use the network to compete in offering users applications for products and markets. These technological innovations are interoperable and composable by design. Market participants can leverage the platform they own to move away from siloed and inefficient centralized systems and build an open ecosystem of innovative applications. 

# Shared infrastructure and application platform
### The problem
The maritime shipping and international trade industry operate on disconnected proprietary platforms. Market participants rely on multiple proprietary platforms, provided by one or more intermediaries, that encompass infrastructure and rules required by users to transact with each other. 
### A design decision
A fundamental design decision for the industry that aspires to achieve operational efficiency, become carbon neutral, and expand it, is whether to preserve proprietary controlled platforms or develop open blockchain platforms that rivals can share. <br><br>
On a decentralized shared platform, such as an open blockchain, multiple firms and developers collaborate in developing the platform's technology that constitutes infrastructure for the industry. Anyone can use the network to compete in offering users interoperable and composable applications. Because the applications are built on the same platform they create a decentralized ecosystem of services. In decentralized systems, value accrues to the platform and its users rather than intermediaries. These systems are much more resilient because they are distributed and maintained by open-source communities.
###  Open-source development
Building a web3 digital ecosystem is a task too large and too important for any corporate organization to tackle on its own. Market participants, policymakers, innovators, companies, universities, and investors all need to collaborate in this work. <br><br> 
By bringing together Web3 and maritime we create the potential for the industry to explore new futures, achieve environmental goals, and create new markets. The foundation mediates this process on behalf of all market participants.
 
## WMF pillars


### Shared digital infrastructure
We support experimental base protocols that use novel technologies, such as zero-knowledge cryptography. WMF projects aim to push the boundaries of what is technically possible in public infrastructure systems and collective ownership and development.
### Application platform and ecosystem 
Web3-Maritime requires new tools and applications. We encourage the development on open ecosystem values, of composable technologies.
### Education and coordination of market participants.<br>
We raise awareness and build capacity. We bring more shipping and maritime companies, developers, technologists, and leaders to the frontiers of decentralized web3 maritime development. We do this through educational programs, and other community initiatives.<br> 

The Web3 Maritime Foundation, 0XMAR, is entirely funded by the workshops and advisor services we deliver.

# WMF is a web3-organisation
In the future WMF will offer digital membership to maritime organizations and companies that are ready to embrace industry wide digital technology in their operations. The WMF initiative is establishing novel decentralized management and governance structures that we will anounce soon. You can think of WMF as the Web 3 version of a credit union or cooperative: think of a community of people that contribute to the joint development of a product, rather than a product being engineered and sold to individuals. We welcome you to join us and make a difference together.<br>

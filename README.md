The Web3 Maritime Foundation promotes an ecosystem and application-level innovation on decentralized platforms specifically designed to serve the needs of the industry. Our primary areas of focus are:<br><br>
### Research and development. <br> 
We support experimental decentralized applications that use novel technologies, such as zero-knowledge cryptography. We support projects aiming to push the boundaries of what is technically possible with blockchain applications and open-source tools

### Application ecosystem and infrastructure.<br> 
Web3-Maritime requires new tools and infrastructure. We encourage the development of these tools with open ecosystem values.
Education and ecosystem development. We aim to raise awareness and bring more shipping and maritime companies, developers, technologists, and leaders to the frontiers of decentralized web3-maritime development. We do this through educational programs and other community initiatives.<br> <br> 

0xMAR is entirely funded by the workshops and advisor services we deliver.

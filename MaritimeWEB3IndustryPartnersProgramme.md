# Become an industry research partner.
Leaders in the Maritime Shipping have two options: assume the responsibility of shepherding Web 3-maritime innovation in a manner that’s consistent with the industry’s values, or cede this role to others with a different, divergent set of priorities. The choice should be clear.

This project enables industry leaders to participate as launching partners in and support industrial research in  Maritime infrastructure and application platforms.

# Maritime WEB3 Industry Partners Programme

We are announcing an industrial research workshop to promote infrastructure innovation on maritime built on web3 platformss powered by zero-knowledge cryptography. The aim of this partnership is to shape the vision, specifications, and strategy for a shared decentralized open infrastructure ecosystem consisting of interoperable platform applications that can scale globally.<br><br> 
We focus on the following:

### Vision and Architecture
Investigate available solutions that provide strong security guarantees and privacy while being public and permission free. Design the specifications and requirements for a open source blockchain protocol to serve as a foundational layer to deploy application platforms. 

### Base blockchain prototype
Implement design and architecture outcome to develop a functioning prototype 

### Interoperable applications ecosystem
We aim to help bring into market platform applications such as:
* Supply chain full service platforms
* Decentralized Automated Freight Markets
* Data markets platform
* Decentralized Financial Institutions and alternative finance products

# Become an industry research partner.
Leaders in the Maritime Shipping have two options: assume the responsibility of shepherding Web 3-maritime innovation in a manner that’s consistent with the industry’s values, or cede this role to others with a different, divergent set of priorities. The choice should be clear.

This project enables industry leaders to participate as launching partners in and support industrial research in  Maritime infrastructure and application platforms. Do you want to participate through our partners and sponsors program? Interested in taking advantage of these digital infrastructure systems in your organization? Schedule an in-person meeting with us.<br><br>
Let’s bring the web3 to Maritime!
